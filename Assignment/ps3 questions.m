% Last week you met with your project groups to orient yourselves
% and (hopefully) map out your initial analyses. We've spent the
% past few weeks in class getting a feel for the types of analyses
% and code structures that are useful with MatLab. Please
% generate the answers to this question with your group; all group
% members can present the same text for this question. Please also
% upload all answers to your group wiki.

%%
% a. (10 points)  In one paragraph each, please provide a
% description of two analyses your group plans to 
% perform. Think of this as if you were writing a grant - for
% each analysis, provide a sentence or two of background, a 
% specific statement of hypothesis, and then describe how you will
% carry out the analysis. Finish each paragraph with a prediction
% of what the next step will be if your analysis is informative.

%%
% b. (10 points)  For each of the analyses in part (a), please
% provide a block of commented pseudocode that will accomplish the
% analyses you've proposed. Be sure to indicate whether you plan to
% use MatLab or something else to execute the various
% parts of your pseudocode. Your pseudocode should identify the
% majority of the functions you'll need for these analyses.

%%
% c. (5 points) Identify the elements of your pseudocode that may
% be slow. Brainstorm on how you could make your code more
% efficient - even if you don't quite know how to accomplish your fix.
