Thank you for visiting our repository.

You will find here all the tools, functions and script used in our project about the structure and composition of protein sector (see the Project folder) as well as the final paper summarizing our findings (see the Paper folder).
The Assignment folder was just used to answer one of the question during a problem set, nothing very interesting in there.

If you have any question about how to use the functions or tools presented in here, do not hesitate to contact Maeva Fincker : mfincker@stanford.edu
